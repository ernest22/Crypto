# MEV 
Inquiry into MEV is interesting due to the progress that it has made - not only in miner activity but - within the ecosystem as well, interoperating with questions on fairness, game theory and codifiable norms

What should fairness look like? Should good practices remain a convention or be a legislation? And if a contract can reverse “bad” actions, should we even allow such thing? From market design, is it possible to minimise harm and optimise efficiency?
